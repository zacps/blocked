# blocked

```toml
# Cargo.toml
blocked = "^0.1.1"
```

Blocked provides the `blocked!` macro. When compiled it will check whether the referenced issue has been closed and emit a compile warning if it has.

This macro takes an issue pattern and an optional 'reason'.

When the `BLOCKED_GITHUB_API_KEY` environment variable is found, or a CI env is detected, this macro will attempt to find the status of the referenced issue.
If the issue has been closed blocked will emit a warning containing the optional 'reason'.

Because this requires network access, it is recommended this is only run in CI builds so as to not slow down the edit-run-debug cycle.

```rust
// An attribute-like procedural macro is on the todo-list
#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene)]

use blocked::blocked;

fn hacky_workaround() {}

fn main() {
    blocked!("1", "This code can be removed when the issue is closed");
    hacky_workaround();

    // The reason is optional
    blocked!("1");
}
```
